# Service runs as testuser1. Hook has inject_user_env: none.
# With injection disabled, the hook should NOT get testuser1's env vars
# injected — USER should come from the inherited service env (which has
# testuser1's injected values from the service level).
# This test verifies inject_user_env: none on a hook prevents hook-level injection.
# We verify by checking that the hook sees the service's environment as-is.
