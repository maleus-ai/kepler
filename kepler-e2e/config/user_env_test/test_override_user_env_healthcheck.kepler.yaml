# Service with a healthcheck that has user_identity enabled (default).
# The service explicitly sets HOME, but the healthcheck's user_identity
# forces HOME to match testuser1's /etc/passwd entry.
# The healthcheck asserts that USER == testuser1 (from /etc/passwd, not from
# the service's explicit environment). If user_identity works, the check
# passes -> service becomes healthy.
